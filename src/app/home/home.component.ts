				Dear Neighbors,
			</p>
			<p>
				Happy Spring! Now that the weather is warmer, many residents are making changes to the exterior of their homes. Please remember that ANY exterior change, such as painting, changing your landscaping, or adding a fence requires a Modification Request Form to be submitted to our Architectural Review Committee. For your convenience, the MRF is available under the documents tab. The very helpful ARC Guidelines and the Covenant Highlights are also available. Please review these documents as they have recently been updated.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have any questions, please reach out to our AMAG (our management company) at <a href="mailto:admin@associationmgt.com">admin@associationmgt.com</a> or 678-407-1115.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you!
